# Destiny Child NSFW-Friendly Wiki

This folder contains information and backups of the Destiny Child NSFW wiki with full modding guides and mod links with previews. It is currently hosted at [HGames Wiki / Destiny Child](http://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Destiny_Child) since [HGames](http://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/) is a free NSFW-friendly wiki.

The wiki is powered by [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), so see there for general help on how to edit pages, etc.
