# Destiny Child NSFW-Friendly Wiki

This folder contains information and backups of the Destiny Child NSFW wiki with full modding guides and mod links with previews. It is currently hosted at http://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Destiny_Child since http://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/ is a free NSFW-friendly wiki.

The wiki is powered by [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), so see there for general help on how to edit pages, etc.

==Backups==

The [backups](./backups/) folder contains periodic backups of the blog content to be used in restoring if the blog is ever lost. To generate a full export:

# Go to [The Export Page](http://wiki.anime-sharing.com/hgames/index.php?title=Special:Export)

# Click the `Add` button to generate a list of all pages to export
# Leave "Include only the current revision, not the full history" checked
# Check "Include templates"
# Leave "Save as file" checked
