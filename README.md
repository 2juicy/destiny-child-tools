## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to these tools through the [GitHub Pull Request Ssytem](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). You can find various tutorials on using Git and GitHub online like [this one](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

The first step is to create your own fork of [the primary repository](https://github.com/LokiCoder/destiny-child-tools) by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right. This will create a copy of the repository at `https://github.com/[your-github-username]/destiny-child-tools`. Next you can clone your repository to your local machine, make changes, commit them using git, and push them back up to GitHub on your account. You can then click "Create New Pull Request", which will prompt [Loki](https://github.com/LokiCoder) to review and merge your changes into the main repository.

### Development

**Prerequisites:**

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional, but usually better than `npm`)

To start a development server, install/update dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn` (if you are using yarn). You should only have to do this when new dependencies have been added to `package.json`.

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start a development server running on http://localhost:8080 to be able to see the result of your changes locally.

## Contributing

Documentation on contributing to this project is coming soon. For now, ping `Loki` on the [Destiny Child Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ahv7SM).
