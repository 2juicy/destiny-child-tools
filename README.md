## Development

**Prerequisites:**

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional, but usually better than `npm`)

To start a development server, install/update dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn` (if you are using yarn). You should only have to do this when new dependencies have been added to `package.json`.

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start a development server to be able to see the result of your changes locally.

## Contributing

Documentation on contributing to this project is coming soon. For now, ping `Loki` on the [Destiny Child Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ahv7SM).
